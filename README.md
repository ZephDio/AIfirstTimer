A little IA I did just for fun by curiosity

There is no scording systeme so you have to choose your element you want to clone and execute this into the console
N({id of the element you want to clone},{number of clones you want})

You can splice the array from an Id to keep only the above element with

C({id of the element you want to keep})

I might add a scoring system later
